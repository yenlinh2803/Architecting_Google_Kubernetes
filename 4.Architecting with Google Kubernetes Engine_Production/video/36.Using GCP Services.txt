Let's start by learning
how to use GCP services. In this first video, you will learn about the pros and cons of using GCP managed storage services versus self-managed
containerized storage. There are several
storage options for applications running on
Google Kubernetes Engine. They make different trade-offs, and you can choose whichever is right for your applications. Kubernetes provides
storage abstractions, volumes and persistent volumes, which you can use to offer storage to applications
in your cluster. You learned about those in another module in
this specialization. In this module, you
will learn about the alternative GCP
managed storage solutions. Remember that volumes and
persistent volumes provide file system capacity accessible directly to your applications. You can use these for
durable file storage, or as a backing store
for databases, or other storage services that you deploy and
manage yourself. In GKE, these are
typically backed by Compute Engine
persistent disks. However, if you use these Kubernetes
storage abstractions, you will have to manage the storage services
you build using them. For example, you can
build and deploy a MySQL server as
a container yourself, using a Kubernetes volume
based on persistent disks, to store the database files. You will however have to manage the server application
life cycle yourself. You'll be entirely
responsible for building a resilient unreliable service. You may want to focus
on your application rather than maintaining
a storage service for it. Google Clouds fully managed database and storage
services reduced the work it takes to
store all kinds of data. The relational and non-relational database and object
storage services of GCP can help remove
operational management burden. You will learn more about each of these services later
in the module.
