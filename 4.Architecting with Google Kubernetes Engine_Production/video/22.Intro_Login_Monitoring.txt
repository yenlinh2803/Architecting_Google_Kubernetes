Hi, I'm Sowmya. Welcome to the Google
Kubernetes engine or GKE Logging and
Monitoring Module. In this module, you'll learn how logging is implemented
in Kubernetes, and how GKE extends that basic functionality
using stackdriver. Stackdriver is a suite of multi-cloud resource
reconnaissance tools, provided by Google that
includes monitoring, logging, and debugging for your applications
and infrastructure. In this module,
you will learn how to use stackdriver to monitor, and manage the availability, and performance of
your GCP resources, and applications that are
built with those resources. Locate and inspect
Kubernetes logs produced by resources
inside your GKE clusters, use stackdriver and
Google BigQuery, for longer-term retention,
and forensic analysis of the logs that are produced by GKE and the Kubernetes resources, inside your GKE clusters. How to monitor system, and application performance from different vantage points, and how to create probes for wellness checks on the
applications you are running.
