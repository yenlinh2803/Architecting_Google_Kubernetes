Hi, I'm Praveen. Welcome to the using GCP managed storage services
with GK module. When you implement
solutions using GK, you can choose to build your own storage solutions by attaching volumes to containers, but these require you to manage and protect your data yourself. You can also choose to use
GCP managed storage services, so it becomes
Google's job to manage the availability and
performance of your data. This is the theme
for this module. In this module, you
will learn how to recognize the pros and cons of managed storage services versus self-managed
containerized storage, identify use cases for Cloud Storage for applications running in a Kubernetes cluster, understand the range of GCP
managed database services, and how to simplify the task of connecting from within Kubernetes applications
to Cloud SQL, one of those services
using the Cloud SQL Proxy.
