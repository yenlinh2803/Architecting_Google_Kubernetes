Now, let's look at the types of managed database services
provided by GCP. In this video, we will look at the key features
of Cloud Bigtable, BigQuery, Cloud Firestore,
Cloud SQL, and Cloud Spanner. You will also learn how to use Cloud SQL Proxy to simplify the process of connecting GKE applications to
Cloud SQL instances. You can use the same
approach that you use to access Cloud Storage for accessing other GCP services
such as Cloud Bigtable, BigQuery, Cloud Firestore,
Cloud SQL, and Cloud Spanner. GCP's database services
serve two overall purposes. Many are suitable for use
to support an applications online data use such as its storage and
retrieval of data. On the other hand, GCP also offers an analytics
database service that's optimized for data mining and discovery of patterns and trends. In turn, the database
services that back online applications fall into the categories of SQL and NoSQL. SQL database services
are for relational data, and you choose them when you want the database engine to help you enforce the semantics
of the database. NoSQL database services are
for flexibly structured data, and it's up to
your application to maintain your data's integrity. You will learn how
to choose among these database services
later in this lesson. But whichever you choose, make sure that you enable
the API of the service and give your applications appropriate
Cloud IAM service accounts. You will do this in
the lab for Cloud SQL.
