In this lab, you will set up
a Kubernetes deployment of WordPress connect it to
Cloud SQL, wireless SQL proxy. The SQL proxy lets you interact
with a Cloud SQL instance as if it was installed
locally over the port 3306. Even though you're on
an unsecured port locally, the SQL proxy makes sure you are secure over the wire to
your Cloud SQL instance. During this lab, you will
create a GKE cluster, then you will create a Cloud
SQL instance to connect to, followed by a service account
to provide permission for your ports to access
the Cloud SQL instance. Finally, you will deploy
WordPress on your GKE cluster, with the SQL proxy as a site card connected to
your Cloud SQL instance.
