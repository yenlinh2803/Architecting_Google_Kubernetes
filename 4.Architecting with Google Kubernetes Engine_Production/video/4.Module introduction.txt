Hi. I'm Maya. Welcome to the Access
Control and Security in Kubernetes and
Google Kubernetes engine module. In previous modules,
you've learned how to run workloads
in your cluster. Now, you'll learn how to make sure that appropriate
access policies are in place to make your cluster and
applications more secure. In this module, you'll learn how to understand Kubernetes
authentication and authorization in order to
control who is able to perform what actions to
resources in your GKE clusters. You'll learn about
role-based access control, which we shorten to RBAC. Kubernetes RBAC, lets you
define roles and role bindings, so you can manage access to resources and
commodities namespaces. You'll also learn to define Kubernetes are
back cluster roles and role bindings to manage
resources that are within the scope of
a cluster that includes, sharing roles across
namespaces and granting permissions
across all namespaces. You'll learn about defining Kubernetes pods
security policies, to only allow pods with specific security-related
attributes to run. You'll also learn more
about the structure of Google Cloud identity
and access management, which we shorten to Cloud IAM, and define IAM rules
and policies for Google Kubernetes Engine
cluster administration.
