The last transactional
GCP database service that we will discuss
is Cloud Spanner. It's like Cloud
SQL in a number of phase but it also has
some important differences. Like cloud SQL, Cloud Spanner is a relational database
service that offers asset consistency guarantees
for transactions. Unlike Cloud SQL, Cloud Spanner
is globally distributed. Even if you choose to host a Cloud Spanner database
across multiple GCP regions, it offers strong consistency
guarantees for transactions. Cloud Spanner is semantically indistinguishable from
single machine database. That property makes it ideal for applications with
a wide geographic reach. Unlike Cloud SQL, Cloud Spanner
is horizontally scalable. If you need more storage or transactions per
second capacity, you can simply add Cloud Spanner notes to your existing instances. At the time of making this video, the maximum capacity of
a Cloud SQL database is little more than 10 terabytes but Cloud Spanner scales
into the petabytes range. In global financial
trading applications, traditional database
solutions rely on very complex infrastructure to ensure that the
transactional integrity of trading is maintained
at a global scale. But Cloud Spanners
globally consistent data removes much of this complexity needed for these solutions. Similarly, insurance,
call center, supply chain management,
telecom, logistics, and e-commerce businesses
that operate applications or web services on a global scale or a good match
for Cloud Spanner. Using Cloud Spanner,
you can build highly interactive online gaming solutions on a global scale. Traditional database
solutions often require significant trade-offs
in order to ensure consistent state for players
which can prevent games from scaling beyond single servers or limited geographic regions
