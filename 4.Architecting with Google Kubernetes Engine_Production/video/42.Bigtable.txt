Now I will introduce you to each of the GCP database services. You can use each of them within Kubernetes applications
running in GK and each of them is suited
for particular use cases. First, what's Cloud Bigtable? It's Google's NoSQL database
that's designed for scale. Bigtable stores data in massively scalable tables each of which is a map from a single
key to a wide column. Choose Bigtable when you have flood data that
fits in one row per key and when you need
access latencies for your data to be in
the millisecond range. Also, choose Bigtable when
you need a database that scales linearly as you
add more notes to it. Cloud Bigtable can
scale up to petabytes of data and smoothly handle millions of operations per second with a latency of
less than ten milliseconds. This makes it suitable for
applications that require very high throughput and scalability for
non-structured key-value data. It is an excellent
storage solution for MapReduce operations because it uses the same APA for database access as Apache HBase. It's also commonly used for stream processing and analytics and machine learning
applications. You can use Cloud Bigtable
for applications that store and query time series data, marketing data, financial data, IOT data and more.
