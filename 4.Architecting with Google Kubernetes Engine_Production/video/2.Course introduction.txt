Hi, I'm Brian. Thanks for taking part in the Architecting with Google Kubernetes Engine specialization. The specialization as a whole, will teach you how to
implement solutions using Google Kubernetes Engine. In this course, architecting with Google Kubernetes
Engine production, each module aims to build on your ability to architect with GKE and includes hands-on labs for you to experience
functionalities firsthand. What the modules in
this course have in common is that they all focus on issues that will affect how your application
runs in production. In this access control
and security module, you'll learn how to define identity and access
management roles for GKE as well as Kubernetes
pods security policies. There's no way to
deliver a reliable and maintainable unless you've built an infrastructure for
logging and monitoring. Monitoring your application
lets you make decisions about it based on data rather
than on good impressions. Lastly, you'll be introduced to use cases for a range of GCP manage storage services within
Kubernetes applications. You could implement
your own storage systems and that's a valid choice. But using managed services can help you get into
production faster, so they're worth
your consideration.
