In this lab, you will
create namespaces with energy K cluster and then use
role-based access control, to permit a non-admin
user to work with ports in a specific namespace. You'll learn, how to
create namespaces for users to control access
to cluster resources, and create roles and roll bindings to control
access within a namespace.
