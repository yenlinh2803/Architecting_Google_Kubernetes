That concludes Google Kubernetes Engine logging and monitoring. In this module, you learned how to use Stackdriver to monitor and manage the availability
and performance of your GCP resources and applications that are built
with those resources, locate and inspect
Kubernetes logs produced by resources
inside your GKE clusters, use Stackdriver and
Google BigQuery for longer-term retention and forensic analysis of
the logs produced by GKE and the Kubernetes resources
inside your GKE clusters, how to monitor system and application performance from
different vantage points, and create probes for wellness checks on
live applications.
