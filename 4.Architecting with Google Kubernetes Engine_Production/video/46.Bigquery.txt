You have learned about
GCP's database services that are suitable for
backing online applications. Now, I will tell you about GCP's data about hosting service. Even though BigQuery
supports SQL queries, it's different from
Google Cloud's other relational
database services in that it's a columnar store. That means it's
optimized for analyzing data sets rather than for making row by
row queries and changes. Running the data by
host can be a lot of work but BigQuery manages the technical aspects of storing structured data
including compression, encryption, replication,
performance tuning, and scaling. Also, a traditional
data warehouse can be expensive even when
you're not using it. But a key advantage of BigQuery is that your data
storage is billed separately from any compute
charges and you only incur compute charges
when you're running a query. BigQuery provides a data
warehousing back end for modern business
intelligence solutions. It enables data integration,
transformation, analysis, visualization, and
reporting using tools from Google
and third parties. A lot of people use BigQuery
as part of a real-time inventory logistics and
supply chain applications. You can load incoming inventory
and even stream data into BigQuery to provide the data warehousing
functions and analytics. BigQuery is ideal for storing vast quantities of
event and sensor data that IoT or Internet of Things
Applications generate. This type of data tends
to have the right once, read many Access Profile that BigQuery is optimized to handle. BigQuery can then perform
ad-hoc analysis or an advanced analytics or create additional derived data for
reporting and analytics. You can use BigQuery for applications that must
consume and analyze extremely large volumes of historical or live
streaming even data. BigQuery is also suitable
if you have applications that must support logging of
even data on a large scale. It's default quota for incoming streaming data is
100,000 rows per second. If that limit is not
sufficient for your needs, just ask Google Cloud support
to increase your quota. You can also use BigQuery to store and analyze
user profile and activity data on
a large scale for predictive digital
marketing applications.
