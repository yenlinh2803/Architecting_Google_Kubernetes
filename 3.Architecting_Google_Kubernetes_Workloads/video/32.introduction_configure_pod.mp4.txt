In this lab, you set up
an application in GK, and then use a Horizontal
Pod Autoscaler to autoscale the web application. You'll then work with
multiple node pools of different types, and apply taints and
tolerances to control the scheduling of parts with respect to the
underlying node pool. Your first task will be to
create a GK cluster and a deployment manifest for a set of pods within the cluster, that you will then use to test DNS resolution of the pods
and service names. In the next task, you will configure
the cluster to automatically scale the sample application
that you deployed earlier. Finally, you create a new pool of nodes using preemptible
instances and then you'll constraint
the web deployment to run only on
the preemptible nodes.
