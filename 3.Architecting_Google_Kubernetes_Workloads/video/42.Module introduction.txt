Hi I'm Priyanka. Welcome to the Google
Kubernetes Engine networking module. When designing your applications, you need to understand
what other types of services it will talk to and
where they may be located. You also need to consider how to expose your applications
to the outside world for consumption and how to balance incoming traffic to cope with
wearing workload demands. That's the theme for this module. In this module, you will
learn how to create services to expose applications
running within a pod, allowing them to
communicate with each other and with the outside world. Use load balancers to expose services to external clients, and spread incoming
traffic across your cluster as
evenly as possible. Create ingress resources for HTTP or HTTPS load balancing, and leverage
container native load balancing to allow
you to directly configure pods as
network endpoints with Google Cloud Load Balancing.
