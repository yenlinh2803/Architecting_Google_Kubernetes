In this lab, you will set up persistent volumes and
persistent volume claims. Persistent volumes
are storage that is available to
a Kubernetes cluster. Persistent volume claims enable pods to access
persistent volumes. Without persistent volume claims, pods are mostly ephemeral. So you should use persistent volume claims
for any data that you expect to survive pod scaling,
updating, and migrating. The tasks that you will perform include creating manifest for persistent volume and
persistent volume claims for Compute Engine
persistent disks, mounting Compute Engine
persistent disk PVCs as volumes in pods and using manifests to
create stateful sets. You will also mount
Compute Engine Persistent Disk PVCs as
volumes in stateful sets and verify the connection of
pods in the stateful sets to particular PVs as the pods
are stopped and restarted.
