In this lab, you will define
a run jobs and cron jobs. In GKE, job as a controller object that
represents a finite task. Your first task will be
to create a GKE cluster. Create a job, inspect
its status, and then remove it. You can create
cron Jobs to perform finite time-related task that run once or repeatedly at
a time that you specify. For your second task, you'll
create and run a cron job. In order to stop the cron job and clean up the jobs
associated with it, you will then delete
the cron job.
