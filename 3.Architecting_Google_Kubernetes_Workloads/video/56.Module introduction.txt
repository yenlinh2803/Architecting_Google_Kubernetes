Hi, I'm Priyanka. Welcome to the persistent data
and storage module. In this module, you
will learn about the different types of
Kubernetes storage abstractions. You'll learn about StatefulSets, and how to use them to manage order deployments of
pods and storage. You'll also learn how
ConfigMaps can save your time during
application deployments, by decoupling
configuration artifacts from container definitions. Finally, you'll learn how to
keep sensitive information safer from accidental exposures
using Kubernetes secrets. In this module, you
will learn how to understand and work with
Kubernetes storage abstractions, which will allow you to
select and configure the appropriate storage types
for your applications. Run and maintains sets of
pods with stable identities, and consistent storage
suitable for stateful applications
using StatefulSets. Use ConfigMaps to decouple configurations from pods so that you don't have to
configure variables in individual pods
specifications, which simplifies management and prevents configuration drift. Manage and store sensitive authorization and authentication
configuration data, for pods such as passwords, OAuth tokens, and SSH keys.
