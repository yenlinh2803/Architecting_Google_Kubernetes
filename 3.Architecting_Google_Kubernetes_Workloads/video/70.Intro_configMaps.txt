In this lab, you will setup configuration
information, both encrypted and unencrypted. Encrypted configuration
information is stored as Secrets. Unencrypted configuration
information is stored as ConfigMaps. This approach avoids hard coding
such information into code basis. Credentials such API keys that belong
in Secrets should never travel inside cooled repositories like GitHub unless
they're encrypted before going in. Even then, though,
it's better to keep them separate. The tasks in the lab will provide you with
the opportunity to create Secrets and ConfigMaps using the kubectl commands and
manifest files. You'll also consume Secrets and ConfigMaps in containers by using
environment variables or mounted volumes.
