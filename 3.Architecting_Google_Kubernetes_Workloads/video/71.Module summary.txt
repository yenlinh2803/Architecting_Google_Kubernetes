That concludes
persistent data and storage. In this module,
you learned how to understand and work with
Kubernetes storage abstractions, which will allow you to
configure and select the appropriate storage type
for your applications, run and maintain sets of
pods with stable identities, and consistent
storage suitable for stateful applications
using stateful sets. Use ConfigMap to decouple
configuration from pods so that you don't have to
configure variables in individual pods
specifications, simplify management and
preventing configuration drift, and manage and store
sensitive authorization and authentication
configuration data for pods such as password, or tokens and SSH keys.
