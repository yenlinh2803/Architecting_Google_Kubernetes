That concludes Google
Kubernetes Engine networking, the sixth module in
architecting with GCP container
infrastructure course. In this module, you
learnt how to create services to expose applications
running within pods, allowing them to communicate
with each other, and the outside world. Use load balancers to explore services to external clients, and spread incoming
traffic across your clusters as
evenly as possible. Create ingress resources for HTTP or HTTP(S) load balancing, for specialized external
load balancing of traffic. Leverage container native load balancing to allow
you to directly configure pods as
network endpoints with Google Cloud load balancing.
