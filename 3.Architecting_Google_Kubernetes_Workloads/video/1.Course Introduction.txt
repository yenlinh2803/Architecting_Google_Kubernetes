Hi, I'm Brian. Thanks for taking part
in the Architecting with Google Kubernetes
Engine specialization. The specialization as
a whole will teach you how to implement solutions using
Google Kubernetes Engine. In this course, Architecting with Google Kubernetes
Engine workloads, each module aims to build on your ability to
architect with GKE, and includes hands-on
labs for you to experience
functionalities firsthand. What the modules in
this course have in common is that they all focus on the tools at
your disposal to shape what runs inside your
Kubernetes cluster. In the Kubernetes
operations module, you'll be introduced to
the Kubectl command, a utility used to control
Kubernetes clusters. The next module addresses how to create and
use deployments, as well as creating
run jobs and cron jobs. You'll also be
introduced to Helm, an open-source package
manager for Kubernetes, as well as Google Cloud's
Kubernetes marketplace which allows you to
conveniently install, package software into
your Kubernetes cluster. The GKE networking module will introduce the creation
of services, and the use of load balancers to expose services to
external clients. Understanding and working with different Kubernetes
storage abstractions is addressed in the persistent
data and storage module.
