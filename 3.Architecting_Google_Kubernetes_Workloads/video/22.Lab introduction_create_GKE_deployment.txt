In this lab, it's more of the basics
of using deployment manifests. The first task that
you'll learn to perform, is to create a deployment manifest for
a pod inside of the cluster. You'll then use both the GCB Console and Cloud Shell to immediately
scale pods up and down. The next task will be to
trigger deployment roll out and a deployment rollback. Parts can be of various service types. Cluster IP, node port, load balancer,
which can be defined in the manifest. You'll perform a task where you define
service types in the manifest and verify load balancer creation. In your final task,
you'll create a new canary deployment for the release of your application.
