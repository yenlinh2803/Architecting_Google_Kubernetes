In this lab you'll use the command
line to build GKE clusters. You'll inspect the kubeconfig file and
use kubectl to manipulate the cluster. The tasks that you'll learn to perform
include using Cloud Shell to deploy GKE clusters. Modifying the number of
nodes in a GKE cluster, and authenticating to a GKE cluster. You'll then use the Cloud Shell
code editor to inspect the QCTL configuration files. You'll also use Cloud Shell and
QCTL to inspect the GKE cluster and use Cloud Shell to deploy
pods to GKE clusters. Lastly, you'll introspect GKE pods by
connecting to a pod to adjust settings, edit files, and
make other live changes to the pod
