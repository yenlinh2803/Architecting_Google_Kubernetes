In this lab, you will use the command line to
build GKE clusters. You'll inspect
the queue conflict file and use Cube CTL to
manipulate the cluster. The task that you'll
learn to perform include using Cloud Shelf to
deployed GKE clusters, modifying the number of
nodes in a GKE cluster, and authenticating
to a GKE cluster. You'll then use the cloud
shield code editor to inspect the Cube CTL
configuration files. You'll also use Cloud Shelf and Cube CTL to inspect
a GKE cluster, and use Cloud Shelf to
deploy pods to GKE clusters. Lastly, you'll
introspect GKE pods by connecting to adjust
settings and files, and make other life
changes to the pod.
