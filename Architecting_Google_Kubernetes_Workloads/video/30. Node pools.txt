Cluster will contain
one or more node pools. The node pool size can be set by specifying a minimum
and maximum size. You can scale down some of the node pools in
a cluster to zero. However, the overall cluster size can never be scaled to zero. At least one node
is required within a cluster to have
system pods running. The cluster auto scaler has
been tested to a maximum of 1000 nodes with
each running 30 pods. However, standard
GCP quota limits for your total number of Compute
Engine instances will apply. If you haven't increased
your default quota, you'll eventually see
disruption and new VMs won't be started until
the quota limit is raised. Here's some gcloud commands
for autoscaling. You can start a cluster with autoscaling enabled
for the default pool. You can add a new pool
with autoscaling enabled or enable autoscaling
for an existing node pool. You can also disable autoscaling for
an existing node pool. If autoscaling is disabled, the node pool size
will be fixed at the clusters
current node pool size. You can also carry out all of these actions from
the GCP console.
