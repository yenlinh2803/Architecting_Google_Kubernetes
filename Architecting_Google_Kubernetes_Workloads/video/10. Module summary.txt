That concludes the Kubernetes
operation module. Let me recap some of
the key learning points. Kubectl transforms
your command line entries into an API call that can be sent to
the cube ATI server within your selected
Kubernetes cluster. Before it can do
any work for you, kubectl must be configured with the location and credentials
of a Kubernetes cluster. Kubectl syntax is composed
of several parts, the command, the type, the name, and optional flags. The command specifies the action
you want to perform such as get the scribe,
logs [inaudible]. Type, defines the Kubernetes object that the command acts on, and name specifies
the object defined in type. Some commands support
additional optional flags that you can include at
the end of the command. You can use kubectl
command to create, view, interact with, and
delete Kubernetes objects. The kubectl get Pods
command returns a list of all deposit in a cluster
and tells you their status. Kubectl describe my [inaudible] and gives you detailed
information about the name Pod. Kubectl [inaudible] allows you to test and debug
within your name Pod. The kubectl logs command allows you the view
the logs of a Pod.
