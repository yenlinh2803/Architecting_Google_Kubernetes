Hi. I'm Alex. Welcome to the Deployment, Jobs and Scaling module. GKE works with
containerized applications. Application package is
a hardware independent, isolated use space instances. In GKE and Kubernetes,
these containers, whether for applications
or batch jobs, are collectively
called workloads. In this module, you'll
learn about deployments and jobs through the main
types of workload. You'll also learn about
the mechanisms that are used to scale the GKE clusters where
you run your applications. In this module, you'll
learn how to create and use deployments including
scaling them, create and run jobs and cronjobs, scale GKE clusters manually
and automatically, control on which node pods
may and not get run, and explore ways to get
software into your cluster.
