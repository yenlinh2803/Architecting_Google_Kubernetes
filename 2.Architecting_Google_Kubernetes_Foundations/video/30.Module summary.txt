That concludes Introduction
to Containers and Kubernetes. In this module, you
learned how to create a container using Cloud build, which will build and manage
your application images. In your labs, you create a Docker formatted container images
and saw how you can privately store them
in Container Registry. You also learned how
to securely manage your builds with the native
integration, with Cloud IAM. You reviewed the four
compute solutions offered by Google Cloud Platform, starting with Compute Engine for those lift and
shift workloads, App Engine, GKE, and
Cloud Functions. Then we weighed
the benefits of each, and looked at
some common use cases. Lastly, you learned that GKE supports automatic
Kubernetes version updates, automatically repair
for unhealthy nodes, and even scaling of
the cluster itself for you. All of this allows you
to focus your time when dreaming up and writing
your next great application. This means less time worrying
about infrastructure, managing and maintaining
deployment environments, worrying about security or building in sharing
your containers, and allows you to focus on building your next
idea for scale. In the next module, you'll learn about
the architecture of Kubernetes.
