Services provide load-balanced access to specified Pods. There are three primary types of Services:

ClusterIP: Exposes the service on an IP address that is only accessible from within this cluster. This is the default type.
NodePort: Exposes the service on the IP address of each node in the cluster, at a specific port number.
LoadBalancer: Exposes the service externally, using a load balancing service provided by a cloud provider.
In Google Kubernetes Engine, LoadBalancers give you access to a regional Network Load Balancing configuration by default. To get access to a global HTTP(S) Load Balancing configuration, you can use an Ingress object.

You will learn more about Services and Ingress objects in a later module in this specialization.
