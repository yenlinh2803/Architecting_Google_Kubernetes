In this lab, you'll access and
become familiar with the GCP Console. You'll also become familiar with
the features of Cloud Shell including the Cloud Shell Code Editor. You'll create buckets, VMs and
service accounts using the GCP Console and Cloud Shell, and execute several other
commands using Cloud Shell as well. You have multiple attempts at
doing this lab inside of Qwiklabs. So once you're satisfied, come back and
you'll watch the solution video, we'll walk through each of these
steps that you just performed.
