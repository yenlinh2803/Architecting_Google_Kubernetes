That concludes the introduction
to Google Cloud Platform module. Let me remind you of what you've learned. Cloud computing is a way to organize your
use of IT in which a provider gives you on-demand access over the network to
resources from a pool that they maintain. You pay for what you use or reserve. The provider maintains
the infrastructure for you, and you can turn it off when you're done. Google Cloud Platform offers lots of
different kinds of cloud computing resources, including four that run
your code for you on Google hardware. In this course,
we're focusing on Kubernetes engine. All the resources offered by GCP
are organized into regions and zones. You can use resources in several zones in a region to increase your
application's resiliency. GCP has a shared security model. You're responsible for defining security
policies for your GCP resources, and the cloud resource management hierarchy
helps you do that in a manageable way. Two important tools that you can use
to manage your use of GCP resources are the GCP Console and Cloud Shell. We'll be using both of those throughout
the rest of this specialization.
