In this lab, you'll build and use GKE clusters and
deploy a sample pod. The tasks that you'll learn
to perform include using the GCP Console to build and
manipulate GKE clusters, deploy a pod, and examine
the cluster and pods. Now, go ahead and
try the quick lab. You have multiple attempts
to complete it, so don't worry if you need more time or want
to practice more. Afterward, come back here
and we'll walk through the lab solution and
key learning points together.
