Hi, I'm Brian. Thanks for taking part
in the Architecting with Google Kubernetes
Engine specialization. You're here because you're
interested in Kubernetes, a software layer
that sits between your applications and
your hardware infrastructure. Because it abstracts away
your underlying infrastructure, it's easier to consistently run and manage your applications. Google Kubernetes Engine
brings you Kubernetes as a managed service on
Google Cloud Platform. The specialization as
a whole will teach you how to implement solutions
using Google Kubernetes Engine. Including, building, scheduling, load balancing, and
monitoring workloads. As well as providing for
discovery of services. Managing role-based access
control and security and providing persistent storage
to these applications. In this course, Architecting with Google
Kubernetes Engine foundation, each module aims to
build on your ability to architect with GKE, and includes hands-on
labs for you to experience
functionalities firsthand. In the first module, you'll be introduced to a range of Google Cloud Platform services and features with a view to helping you choose
the right GCP services, to create your own
cloud solution. You'll learn about
creating a container using Cloud Build and storing a container in
Container Registry. You'll also compare and
contrast the features of Kubernetes and
Google Kubernetes engine, also referred to as GKE. In addition to conceptualizing the Kubernetes architecture, you'll deploy a Kubernetes
cluster using GKE, deploy pods to a GKE cluster and view and managed
Kubernetes objects.
