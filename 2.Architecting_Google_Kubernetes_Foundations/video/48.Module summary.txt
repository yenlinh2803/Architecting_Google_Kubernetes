This concludes the Kubernetes
architecture module. In this module, you learned about
the Kubernetes operating philosophy. Every item under Kubernetes control
is represented by an object. And Kubernetes tries to keep the state of
its cluster matching the state you have declared that you want. You learned about the control playing
components that make up Kubernetes. You learned about Cube API server,
which is the point of control for your Kubernetes cluster. And you learned about Cubelet, which
is your cluster's agent on each node. And you also learned that a GKE managed
cluster implements the master for you, behind the scenes, and that you
are not charged separately for it. To tell Kubernetes what you want
the state of your cluster to be, create manifest files. Typically, you'll build
those files in YAML format. These files name and describe the objects you want
Kubernetes to keep alive and healthy. They also documented the desired
state of your cluster. So you should keep these files
in a source control system.
