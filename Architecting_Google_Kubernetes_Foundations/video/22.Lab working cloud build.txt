In this Lab, you'll build
a Docker container image from provided source code and
a Docker file using Cloud Build. You'll then upload the container
to contain a registry. The tasks that you'll perform include: using Cloud
build to build and push containers and then using container Registry to store
and deploy containers. Remember that you have multiple tries to complete the Lab, so don't worry if
your lab timer runs out. You can always start again. Now, try out the Lab and come back and watch
the solution walkthrough video where we'll
highlight each of the critical points
you just practiced.
