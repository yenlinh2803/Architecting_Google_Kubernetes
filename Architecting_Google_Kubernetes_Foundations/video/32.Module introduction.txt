Welcome to the
Kubernetes architecture, module of our course. It helps to know
the parts of Kubernetes and to understand
the philosophy it implements. How does Kubernetes expect
you to tell it what to do? What choices do you have for
describing your workloads? That's the theme of this module. In this module,
you'll learn how to understand how the Kubernetes
architecture is laid out, deploy a Kubernetes cluster using Google Kubernetes engine, deploy pods to a GKE cluster, and view and manage several very useful
Kubernetes objects.
