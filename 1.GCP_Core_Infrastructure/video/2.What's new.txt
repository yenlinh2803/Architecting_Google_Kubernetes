Here are some of
the recent updates and improvements in this course. We've improved the coverage
of Kubernetes Engine, and added an
explanation of Anthos, which is Google Cloud's
platform for the hybrid cloud, that's built on open source technologies,
like Kubernetes. We've also updated
the course to reflect GCPs new regions and
product releases. Throughout the course,
we've improved our videos accessibility so that
they'll better serve the needs of viewers
with reduced vision. Thank you for taking
part in this course. We look forward to
helping you explore Google Cloud Platform and
to receiving your feedback.
